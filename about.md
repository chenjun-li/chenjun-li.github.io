<p>Hi there, I am currently a PhD student in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University. I obtained my BEng degree from a joint school between University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and University of Glasgow. I enjoy cooking, playing badminton and tennis. I also love road trips and photography. </p>

<p>My research interests lie in the broad field of machine learning, computer vision and medical image analysis. Feel free to leave me a message!</p>
